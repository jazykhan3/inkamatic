          Winner of the 2020 & 2021 British Bank Awards, Freetrade is regularly
          considered one of the best investment platforms in the United Kingdom.
          At first glance, there’s a lot to like about this platform. There are
          two beautifully designed apps (one for iOS and one for Android), they
          claim to offer commission-free investing, and they offer fun features
          like fractional shares. The question is, of course, does Freetrade
          live up to its claims on its website? Let’s see with our in-depth
          Freetrade review!

          Freetrade Review: Some Background Information
        </p>
        <p className="w-full md:text-base text-sm text-[#253146CC] font-light mb-4">
          For those that have not heard of Freetrade, it is an investment
          brokerage based out of London. It was the brainchild of Adam Dodds, an
          immigrant from Canada, and Davide Fioranelli. Adam Dodds was surprised
          by the UK’s trading platforms’ overall quality, so he set out to
          create his own, competing with financial giants like Hargreaves
          Lansdown and AJ Bell.
        </p>
        <p className="w-full md:text-base text-sm text-[#253146CC] font-light mb-4">
          Their goal was quite simple: to create a platform for investors that
          breaks down investing barriers. They wanted to make investing easy for
          people of all technical skill levels.
        </p>
        <p className="w-full md:text-base text-sm text-[#253146CC] font-light mb-4">
          So, in 2016, the company started. It raised £1M in crowdfunding in
          2019 and $15M (£10.8M) in Series A financing later.
        </p>
        <p className="w-full md:text-base text-sm text-[#253146CC] font-light mb-4">
          As of right now, over 600,000 registered users use Freetrade for their
          investments. The app and site have grown immensely in popularity!
        </p>
        <p className="w-full md:text-xl  text-lg font-normal w-full mb-4">
          Who Can Use Freetrade?
        </p>
        <p className="w-full md:text-base text-sm text-[#253146CC] font-light mb-4">
          As you may have guessed from the background information in this
          Freetrade review, this company targets UK investors. Specifically,
          you’ll need to be a UK resident for tax purposes and have a UK bank
          account.
        </p>
        <p className="w-full md:text-base text-sm text-[#253146CC] font-light mb-4">
          One interesting exception to this rule is that US citizens cannot
          apply for an account even if they reside in or are also citizens of
          the United Kingdom. Likely this rule has to do with the sometimes
          demanding FATCA requirements that the US government has.
        </p>
        <p className="w-full md:text-base text-sm text-[#253146CC] font-light mb-4">
          While Freetrade is looking into expanding into new markets including
          Australia, Japan The Netherlands, France and Germany as of right now,
          the products they offer are UK-only.

          What Does Freetrade Offer?
        </p>
        <p className="w-full md:text-base text-sm text-[#253146CC] font-light mb-4">
          With that in mind, let’s take a look at what Freetrade offers
          prospective investors.
        </p>
        <p className="w-full md:text-base text-sm text-[#253146CC] font-light mb-4">

          Freetrade also offers a subscription-based service called Freetrade
          Plus. The gist of this service is that you can access more stocks, get
          higher interest on your cash balances, and access a few more perks for
          £9.99/month. We’ll cover more about what you can do with Freetrade
          Plus and who should sign up for it later in this review.

        <p className="w-full md:text-base text-sm text-[#253146CC] font-light mb-4">
          Freetrade offers an iOS and Android app for trading. They also provide
          an “Invest Hub” centre for people to learn more about the stock market
          and trading in general.
        </p>
        <p className="w-full md:text-base text-sm text-[#253146CC] font-light mb-4">
          There isn’t too much fancy stuff with Freetrade. It’s a relatively
          straightforward brokerage that aims to make investing easy and
          accessible for everyone!

        <p className="w-full md:text-xl  text-lg font-normal w-full mb-4">
          Freetrade Review: What’s Good About This Platform?
        </p>
        <p className="w-full md:text-base text-sm text-[#253146CC] font-light mb-4">
          There are four primary advantages of Freetrade over other similar
          brokerages.
        </p>
        <p className="w-full md:text-xl  text-lg font-normal w-full mb-4">£0 Commissions</p>
        <p className="w-full md:text-base text-sm text-[#253146CC] font-light mb-4">
          First, you pay £0 in commission per trade. That’s huge when you
          consider that most investment firms charge anywhere between £8 and £12
          per transaction. While this might not sound like a tremendous amount
          of money to save, it adds up – especially if you’re looking to average
          your investments or buy frequently.
        </p>
        <p className="w-full md:text-base text-sm text-[#253146CC] font-light mb-4">
          To illustrate the power of £0 commissions, consider the following
          example. Instead of buying £1,000 worth of stock all at once, let’s
          say you take the approach of buying £100 per month for ten months.
          This way, you’ll spread out your investments. Accumulating wealth at
          regular intervals is usually one of the best ways to improve your
          financial future.

            When you sign up to Freetrade using the link below, you will get a
            £10 free share when you fund your account with £50 or more within

        </div>

        <p className="w-full md:text-base text-sm text-[#253146CC] font-light mb-4">
          With Freetrade, at the end of your ten months of £100 investing,
          you’ll have invested £1,000. However, with Hargreaves Lansdown, you’ll
          have only put in £885.50 due to the commissions.
        </p>
        <p className="w-full md:text-base text-sm text-[#253146CC] font-light mb-4">
          Now, let’s say your investment rises by 10%, and you decide to sell.
          With Freetrade, your account balance will be £1,100. With Hargreaves
          Lansdown, you’ll only have £956.60.
        </p>
        <p className="w-full md:text-base text-sm text-[#253146CC] font-light mb-4">
          In other words, the stock will have risen by 10%, yet with the £11.95
          commission brokerage, you’ll still be in the negative. With Freetrade,
          you’ll be ahead £100. That’s the power of £0 commission investing!
        </p>
        <p className="w-full md:text-xl  text-lg font-normal w-full mb-4">
          Fractional Shares
        </p>
        <p className="w-full md:text-base text-sm text-[#253146CC] font-light mb-4">
          Freetrade also supports fractional shares! You can buy as little as £2
          worth of any US stock (that’s the minimum order limit on the platform)
          and own a part of it instead of the whole thing. Let’s say you want to
          buy a share of Google, for example. That stock costs thousands of US
          dollars to own one share. However, with Freetrade, you can own part of
          a share and trade with that.
        </p>
        <p className="w-full md:text-base text-sm text-[#253146CC] font-light mb-4">
          By providing investing with £0 commissions and fractional shares,
          Freetrade opens up so many possibilities. You can invest – profitably
          – by even putting £20 a week in stocks.
        </p>
        <p className="w-full md:text-xl  text-lg font-normal w-full mb-4">
          Low Foreign Exchange Rates
        </p>
        <p className="w-full md:text-base text-sm text-[#253146CC] font-light mb-4">
          While Freetrade does not offer the lowest foreign exchange rates of
          any broker, it does offer quite competitive ones. The cost is the spot
          FX rate, plus 0.45%. This amount applies no matter if you convert £100
          or £1 million.
        </p>
        <p className="w-full md:text-base text-sm text-[#253146CC] font-light mb-4">
          By contrast, Hargreaves Lansdown’s rates look like this:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside w-full">
          <li className="md:text-base text-sm text-[#253146CC] font-light mb-2">
            The first £5,000 costs the spot FX rate plus 1.00%.
          </li>
          <li className="md:text-base text-sm text-[#253146CC] font-light mb-2">
            The next £5,000 costs the spot FX rate plus 0.75%.
          </li>
          <li className="md:text-base text-sm text-[#253146CC] font-light mb-2">
            The amount you convert between £10,001 and £20,000 costs the spot
            rate plus 0.5%.
          </li>
          <li className="md:text-base text-sm text-[#253146CC] font-light mb-2">
            Finally, any amount you convert over £20,000 costs the spot FX rate
            plus 0.25%.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p className="w-full md:text-base text-sm text-[#253146CC] font-light mb-4">
          In other words, if you convert £20,000 at Hargreaves Lansdown, you’ll
          pay £137.50 above the spot FX rate. That rate is £90 with Freetrade.
          At £50,000, you’ll pay £212.50 with Hargreaves and £225 with
          Freetrade.
        </p>
        <p className="w-full md:text-base text-sm text-[#253146CC] font-light mb-4">
          Unless you regularly convert tens of thousands of pounds, you’ll
          almost always be better with Freetrade than many other financial
          institutions.
        </p>
        <p className="w-full md:text-base text-sm text-[#253146CC] font-light mb-4">
          Now, with that said, Freetrade does not have the lowest rates. For
          example, Trading 212 has rates that are the spot rate plus 0.15%. On
          those £50,000, you’d only pay £75 above the spot rate – much cheaper
          than most other brokerages! We’d recommend reading our Trading 212 vs
          Freetrade comparison for a more in-depth look at which brokerage is
          better for you.
        </p>
        <p className="w-full md:text-base text-sm text-[#253146CC] font-light mb-4">
          Still, given that Freetrade has relatively low FX rates, that’s a pro
          for this brokerage!
        </p>
        <p className="w-full md:text-xl  text-lg font-normal w-full mb-4">
          No Account Minimums
        </p>
        <p className="w-full md:text-base text-sm text-[#253146CC] font-light mb-4">
          Finally, Freetrade does not have account minimums. You can put as
          little as £1 in your account at the opening! Many other brokerages
          have a £100 or more minimum that you need to put in to open an
          account. The fact that you can even put £10 into an account and buy a
          fractional share is a massive win for people who want to start
          investing without necessarily putting up a lot of money upfront!
        </p>
        <p className="w-full md:text-xl  text-lg font-normal w-full mb-4">
          What’s Bad About This Platform?
        </p>
        <p className="w-full md:text-base text-sm text-[#253146CC] font-light mb-4">
          Now that we’ve taken a look at the good aspects of Freetrade, let’s
          talk about the bad. While Freetrade is a strong brokerage, no place is
          perfect, and Freetrade does have some faults.
        </p>
        <p className="w-full md:text-base text-sm text-[#253146CC] font-light mb-4">
          Freetrade only permits trades through the mobile app. While this isn’t
          necessarily bad for some people, it can feel a little limiting at
          times. The app is powerful and useful, but using your phone to trade
          can sometimes feel slower or more difficult than trading on your
          laptop or desktop. Again, this may not be a massive issue for some,
          but it can feel limiting.
        </p>
        <p className="w-full md:text-base text-sm text-[#253146CC] font-light mb-4">
          The app also doesn’t have quite the same trading and research
          capabilities that some larger brokerages do. In terms of trading,
          you’ll get the bare essentials here, including a chart that shows you
          the pricing. You can select the time scale, enter your dollar amount,
          and hit buy or sell, but that’s about it. You won’t get any super
          in-depth knowledge from this app, nor can you implement any
          complicated strategies.
        </p>
        <p className="w-full md:text-base text-sm text-[#253146CC] font-light mb-4">
          Similarly, in terms of research, there isn’t too much here. There’s a
          “Discover” section, but, again, you can find that type of help
          anywhere online.
        </p>
        <p className="w-full md:text-base text-sm text-[#253146CC] font-light mb-4">
          In other words, Freetrade seems to have developed its product around
          the notion that the app would be the only way to trade and that it
          would be as simple and easy as possible to start trading. There’s no
          complexity or nuance here. For some people, that’s a good thing. For
          others, they’ll need to get their stock market news and more in-depth
          analyses elsewhere. If opening a web browser and pouring over
          comprehensive market data is how you want to trade, Freetrade is not
          for you.

        <p className="w-full md:text-base text-sm text-[#253146CC] font-light mb-4">
          As you can likely tell already from this Freetrade review, there’s a
          lot to like about what Freetrade has to offer. However, complicating
          matters somewhat is the concept of Freetrade Plus. If you’re

          Our review ultimately concluded it wasn’t worth signing up for Plus
          unless you have a lot of money in the Freetrade ecosystem. If you are
          looking to invest £50 a month, for example, in some stocks, the £9.99
          per month fee is hard to justify.

          As you can see, you can do quite a bit for free with this brokerage
          and most of the benefits that Plus provides people are not that useful
          to the average trader. If you find that you need more, you can always
          pay for Plus then, but most people will see the base level is
          perfectly acceptable, especially if you merely want a General
          Investment Account!

          Freetrade Review: Can I Get Free Stocks with Freetrade?
        </p>

        <p className="w-full md:text-base text-sm text-[#253146CC] font-light mb-4">
          One of the nice things about Freetrade is that you can get free stocks
          if you use the right link! That’s right, you can get stocks to start
          your investing journey entirely free by using this link to sign up
          instead of going to Freetrade’s site directly.
        </p>
        <p className="w-full md:text-base text-sm text-[#253146CC] font-light mb-4">
          Of course, Freetrade is not the only stock brokerage to offer free
          shares as an incentive to register. Many other brokers are offering
          these shares. Here’s our short but handy guide for how you can get
          free stocks in the UK from multiple different brokers! We list how to
          get entirely free stocks from companies like Lightyear, Shares, Stake,
          and Trading 212.

          Freetrade Is One of the Best Online Trading Platforms

        <p className="w-full md:text-base text-sm text-[#253146CC] font-light mb-4">
          What Freetrade does well, this company does exceptionally well,
          providing a comfortable, intuitive way to buy and sell stocks for free
          in the UK. Its name is perfect – Freetrade – because that is the
          primary reason to use this brokerage. To be honest, it’s tough to
          argue against this. Trading for free means more money in your pocket,
          and that’s always a good thing!
        </p>
        <p className="w-full md:text-base text-sm text-[#253146CC] font-light mb-4">
          While there are some downsides (like the lack of in-depth market
          analyses and reviews), for beginning investors, there’s nothing out
          there as simple, intuitive, and as free as Freetrade. That’s why we
          wholeheartedly encourage all our readers to claim their free stock and
          at least give Freetrade a spin. You have nothing to lose. You won’t
          have to pay any fees or commissions if you don’t want to, and by
          signing up, you’ll at least gain one free stock!
